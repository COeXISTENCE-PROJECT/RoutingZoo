# RoutingZoo

The main goal of RoutingZoo is to implement the most popular human learning model into RouteRL simulation. Based on the simulation the package create a detailed result, shows the mean value of a given link with its standard deviation, shows thwe TT overal on the system with its standard deviation and the netropy of the agents choice. The package can be used to make recreation of the simulation using the same initial parameters and creating differnt simulations with different parameters.
